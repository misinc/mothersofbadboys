<div class="post-body">
<p class="more-link"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>By Aurore B. Reales <br />
</strong><br />
Meandering among those picturesque houses, we slowly arrived, our disorganized selves. Entering the castle of otherness, where it all seems so perfect that seams are bursting and the puss is about to explode&hellip; We were invited to dinner. <br />
<br />
Robot, the husband, in his vaguely discomforting mixture of success and self-hatred, kept himself on a self-constructed pedestal where he contemptuously looked down on us with helpful tips on how to lead our lives, unaware of his unsympathetic tyranny. <br />
<br />
The invitation to such talk was apparently my recent parent-teacher conference with my son&rsquo;s classroom teacher. It didn&rsquo;t go so well, since the teacher told me I should have him assessed for ADHD. Not only that, but apparently she thinks he has an attitude of not caring about school and no insight into how her attitude may very well damage all his future chances for college and later success in life. <br />
<br />
I asked her if she had a rapport with him, knowing my child is conscientious and cares, if anything too much, about all sorts of things. <br />
<br />
&ldquo;Children should be busy and aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; Robot again. His daughter crying on the way to piano lessons on the days she is not taking swimming lessons &ndash; the best in her class and isn&rsquo;t she pretty? Poor thing refuses to eat. <br />
<br />
&ldquo;Even in our household&hellip;&rdquo;, the wife begins. &ldquo;Even in our household&rdquo; betraying her true need for friendship with me. Well, too true&hellip; we don&rsquo;t have much household to speak of. Their marriage a sour and cynical affair where the players can&rsquo;t even conceal their contempt for each other when a guest is around. Tension creeping up and threatening to strangle us in the middle of the meal. &ldquo;See, I can&rsquo;t cook anything, nothing is ever good enough.&rdquo; &ldquo;My wife is too lazy to drive the kids to their classes and comes up with all kinds of excuses.&rdquo; <br />
<br />
Yes they are just as concerned about our public school. Frankly it is too much for me. Even the teacher has the timbre of the ghetto. She is white, I&rsquo;m not trying to be racist here. I&rsquo;m talking about the American Anger. I can&rsquo;t take it anymore. <br />
<br />
When we first moved here I never wanted to have my kid go to a secluded white European private school. I wanted him to learn the real American society. But that was before I was confronted with the reality of it. Now it doesn&rsquo;t feel like a safe environment I should expose my kid to. Children don&rsquo;t get the attention they need, let alone the education they need. School cuts lead to large classroom sizes and unhappy teachers, and the building is dirty. <br />
<br />
The school yard atmosphere is rough, tough and harsh, lots of bullying. <br />
<br />
Boys are being ostracized. Normal active, bright boys are labeled hyper and the ADHD accusation flies around too often. The kids are not supposed to question, but to follow. They are stuck with mind-numbing repetitive tasks that they quickly see through. Still they are supposed to walk in line. <br />
<br />
&ldquo;What are you reading kid ?&rdquo; He asks my son. <br />
<br />
&ldquo;Mostly mangas.&rdquo; <br />
<br />
&ldquo;What are mangas?&rdquo;. <br />
<br />
&ldquo;The old story of the battle between good and evil like in the ancient myths, excellently drawn,&rdquo; I inform my opponent. <br />
<br />
And he means no harm, he probably thinks he means well. <br />
<br />
Upside down world. I think we would not be so obviously different if we still were in the seventies. I mention something like that with a sigh. I decide to give my son a haircut and remember my friend, a psychologist who lucidly said, &ldquo;Parents who don&rsquo;t love their children, buy them expensive clothes.&rdquo; <br />
<br />
Why would you put so much time on the surface of things when nothing underneath is right? We may be disorganized in my small family and have our issues, but we are emotionally clean, mentally strong and most of all, we know how to love. <br />
<br />
Another kind of poverty and decay is to let go of those values. <br />

This all happened toward the end of Peter&rsquo;s second grade. Summer vacation started shortly after that and by third grade the school had almost forgotten everything. After all, we were not the only ones who had bad experiences with Katie and her mother. And anyway I had certainly been a more visible member of the school community than Katie&rsquo;s mother and I am sure any doubts anybody had about my character did eventually vanish. But the whole incident certainly hurt both Peter and me. </span>&nbsp;<a href="../../post/The_Boy_is_Always_Guilty,_Part_3/index.html">More</a></p></p>

True, the school could have handled it much better, but you know how it is. The school wants to avoid lawsuits and other harassments and they know that sort of thing is not going to come from people like it. But Katie's mother and the stupid orgnization that has bought her story could make a lot of trouble for the school. This is how honest and decent people get screwed by the people who know very well that they are honest and decent. Makes me sick. But we have to be strong.</div>  </div>

I can tell you that it was called, &quot;Norbel,&quot; because it closed down for other reasons. They had a zero tolerance policy against everything. There was a teacher who would all always hug<br /> me all over, and I was a little touchy about being touched if you don't mind the pun, so one day I got sick of it. I thought I had to physically attack her back to get her off of me. And this was because I was traumatized by an incident when I was little and<br /> my dad was tickling me and I told him to stop, but he didn't listen he heard me just fine. I got the words, &quot;don't and stop&quot; out of my mouth through the laughing, but my dad jokingly said, &quot;don't worry, I won't stop.&quot; Anyway, I pushed her back against the<br /> door to the room that I was about to enter and I had to eat lunch by myself instead of the person who I was chosen to eat lunch with that day as a social skill building exercise. And of course, my parents were called, and they locked me in my room for the<br /> rest of the night for what I did and yelled at me. And for a while after graduating, I felt like everyone was always judging me, waiting to give me a guilt trip, and every time someone told me even in the nicest way not to do something I felt like I had done<br /> something as terrible as killing someone. May the schools be punished for this, may there be justice.</div>  </div>

I'm sorry that it took me a while to &quot;release&quot; your comment. You know, we get a lot of spam comments so I now I have to release comments personally one by one -- and now that I'm not on this site very often sometimes<br /> it takes a while! Thanks so much for sharing your story. It really angers me that everybody is always quick to punish the kids, and especially the boys, first. I'm not saying that kids are not sometimes wrong, but we have to first look for what makes kids<br /> do the &quot;wong&quot; thing. And frankly, sometimes I don't think what the kids do is even that wrong. As an adult I would also physically push away someone who touches me when I don't want it. I don't see why kids should not have the same right. But... it sounds<br /> that you have grown up to be a smart and competent person. All power to you and good luck with everything.</div>  </div>

The more I thought about the whole thing the more uneasy I became. At first I had thought nothing of a couple of seven year-olds being curious about each other&rsquo;s body parts. But then I started thinking about what the inspector had said about how kids who are exposed to certain &ldquo;situations&rdquo; at home act those out at school. Frankly, I started getting grossed out. What exactly had gone on between Peter and Katie? What had she suggested to him? Even, what words had she used? </span>&nbsp;<a href="../../post/The_Boy_Is_Always_Guilty,_Part_2/index.html">More</a></p></p>

What is hurtful to him is not a little sexual exploration, it's the stupid school who takes things out on him and you. Schools are so easily intimidated by &quot;advocacy&quot; organizations who threaten lawsuits and stuff. They would rather punish the wrong people than stand up for what's right.</div>  </div>
