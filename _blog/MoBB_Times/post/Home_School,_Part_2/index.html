<div class="post-details">Friday, October 23, 2009</div>
<div class="post-body">
<p class="more-link"><p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; color: #1f497d; font-size: 16px;"><strong>Vincent gets sick</strong></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> <span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 10pt;"><br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;">Tuesday we set off again with much less anticipation and much more trepidation. I didn't enjoy my peace and quiet nearly as much as the day before, wondering how this day would turn out. Vincent came home a bit happier; he'd met another "newbie” and they teamed up for the day. John didn't have the California bad boy label but also didn't know his way around, or all the other kids in sixth grade. Vincent said the music class was actually kind of fun, not much melody but plenty of rhythm.</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 10pt;"><br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;">The rest of the week went rather well. Vincent and John seemed to get along well together and Vince asked if John could come to our house to play on Saturday. John's mother dropped him off and they goofed off for most of the afternoon. I took him home, an adventure in itself as I had never been to that part of town before and John's directions were lousy. </span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">Monday was Labor Day so Vincent had it off.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">Tuesday Vincent was horribly upset when he came home. John had drawn a picture of a woman being decapitated and told him that he, John, would like to do that to me. (No reason given.) Then John bit Vincent and ran off.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">Vincent was also upset because social studies consisted of cutting out Greek pillars and pasting them on another sheet of paper. He'd gotten a B instead of an A because he colored them outside the lines. (We're talking sixth grade here, don't forget!)</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">The next day he was sick when he got up. He refused breakfast and said he felt like he was going to vomit. He didn't have a temperature but did feel clammy so I called the school and let him stay home. Vincent stayed in bed all morning but did get up for lunch. He ate a little and spent the afternoon on the couch reading and worrying about the next day.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 10pt;"><br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;">Thursday morning he was sick again. I made him go to school anyway. The secretary called me a few hours later and said that he was in her office and could I come and get him. I did. Vincent told me that he'd waited in her office an hour before she bothered to call me…</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 10pt;"><br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;">Friday morning was the same. He woke up crying, said he hadn't slept a wink all night and his stomach was upset again. I called the school and asked the secretary to please ask teachers to put assignments together so Vincent could work on them over the weekend.</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 10pt;"><br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;">I also made a doctor’s appointment and luckily they had an opening in the morning. Dr M couldn't find anything wrong and suggested plenty of fluids, light foods, and plenty of bed rest.</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 10pt;"><br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;">I put Vinnie to bed soon after a lunch of toast and juice. He did sleep for awhile and said he felt better. I went to the school at three to pick up homework. The secretary had forgotten to ask the teachers so I went to a few of the rooms to ask for them myself. Only one teacher was still there and she wasn't very nice about getting together the work sheets that Vincent had missed... And thus ended our first two weeks at a Sumtown public school.</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 10pt;"><br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;">The following week was much the same. Vincent would be sick in the morning and not want to go to school. I made him go. I walked him up the hill and would be lucky if I made it home before I started to cry. His computer class consisted of being taught how to turn the machine off and on and how to create a folder. (He'd been doing that for years.) His art teacher asked the class to bring in old magazines to cut up. Vincent told her that we didn't have any and asked if newspapers would do. <br />
She told him no, it had to be magazines. She also said that she had plenty at home but she wanted to teach him responsibility so he would have to find his own. Luckily, our neighbor had some and let us have them.</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 10pt;"><br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;">Vincent was bored in all his classes. I called Mr. X to see if they had any advanced classes (they didn't) and to ask about volunteering. He told me that I wasn't needed in the classroom.</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 10pt;"><br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;">Our weekend was lousy. My husband Dale was home and I'd hoped to go on a picnic. Vincent didn't feel good and wanted to jut stay home and relax. Dale and I did have the opportunity for several private talks about what was going on and decided to wait a few more weeks. A parents’ night was scheduled that Wednesday and Dale and I definitely had questions!</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 10pt;"><br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;">Monday arrived far too quickly. Vincent went to school against his will and came home crying and furious. His lunch box had been stolen and a kid at the lunch table popped his bag so the whole table had to stay in the lunch room instead of getting to go out for recess. Then, to make matters worse, his history teacher also punished the whole class because two kids were talking while her back was turned. I called Mr. X hoping we could talk about some of the problems Vincent was having. His secretary took the message and said he'd get back to me. He didn't.</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 10pt;"><br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;">Tuesday morning Vincent was vomiting so I called the school. The secretary informed me that Vincent had missed too much school and would need a doctor’s excuse when he went back. I made an appointment with Dr. M that afternoon. Once again, he could find nothing wrong and said he thought Vincent was malingering. According to the scale Vincent had lost eight pounds since he was there two weeks ago. Dr. M did write an excuse for the school saying that Vinnie had stomach problems.</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">On Wednesday I promised Vincent that his dad and I would be talking to his teachers that night and we would try to come up with a solution. He came home that afternoon with a sales catalogue filled with over- priced junk that he was supposed to go door to door selling as a fundraiser for the school. The teacher who had passed them out had informed the class that if they didn't sell a certain amount they would not be allowed to go to the Christmas party at school. Neither one of us cared about the party but I was upset that it was a requirement. Vincent took great pleasure in ripping up the catalogue and making confetti out of it. I helped.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 10pt;"><br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;">That evening Dale and I went to parents’ night at school. There were too many people there to be able to talk to the teachers but we did get to see the artwork the kids had done and I admit Vincent's Greek pillars were sloppily colored. (Some of the others were much worse!) We did ask his history teacher about her class punishment and were informed that it was easier for her to do it that way rather than try to find the culprits.</span></span></p>

Sometimes I don't know whether to take it seriously when my kids say they are sick and don't want to go to school in the morning.
