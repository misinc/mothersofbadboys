<div class="post-body">
<p class="more-link"><p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><b><span style="line-height: 150%; color: #1f497d; font-size: 16px;">What I did</span></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">Looking back on second grade one thing particularly stands out in my mind: While Jack hardly ever said anything bad about his teacher <i>she</i> had nothing good to say about him. It was very difficult for me to find out from Jack how he was being treated. I think that was partly because of the independent streak in him that makes him want to take matters in his own hands and partly because he probably saw me as taking the teacher’s side too much. I was definitely guilty of that; now I think I should have taken any even slight complaint that he made more seriously. </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;"><br />
There was also the possibility that for all her negative comments to me Ann was not overtly nasty to Jack.  She did have a degree of professionalism. In fact, many parents liked her very much (although I have gathered over the years that her popularity has diminished). The mother of a very bright and well-behaved classmate of Jack—the kind of kid who is the dream of every teacher—could hardly believe what I was telling her about Ann. My experience was so different from hers. So the fact that Ann had two very different sides contributed to the complications. </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;"><br />
As any honest mother would admit, it is very difficult to know exactly what to do at all time. It is especially hard when you have to react on a daily basis to confused and confusing allegations against a seven-year old. My first reaction was to find out what was going on between Jack and Ann—and when Jack did not seem particularly unhappy or angry, what was I supposed to conclude? Furthermore, our principal that year was an interim one who by virtue of his temporary status was not equipped to give any real assistance. The teachers never accepted him and I knew that they would not have cooperated with him even if he had wanted to help. I felt that I was left to my own devices and resources. I will never be sure that my way of dealing with the situation was the right one, but this is how I went about it.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;"><br />
My first concern, of course, was Jack. To get a seasoned perspective I started talking to a family therapist who had experience with public schools. She and I discussed every incident in detail before she met with Jack. When she met him she found him a typical seven year-old and grounded enough not to be terribly vulnerable. Another therapist who saw Jack more extensively also found him a “resilient” little boy. She told me that even if he was being a little extra unruly in class it was probably his way of fighting back against the teacher’s dislike of him. </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;"><br />
I talked to everyone I knew who had experience with children. One teacher said that kids tend to misbehave when they sense themselves trapped in a “hostile environment.” A high school counselor said that he thought it was actually better in the long run for children to feel a sense of control by “fighting back” when they feel unfairly treated. A therapist friend told me that surrendering to a “whipped dog” attitude is the onset of depression. </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;"><br />
As I looked more closely at what was going on and talked with others at school I became somewhat reassured that there were people who were looking out for Jack. There is only so much damage a teacher can do when a lot of people are watching her. I also began to see that I was more the object of Ann’s dislike than Jack and that a lot of her attacks were directed at me. So I thought that the best coping strategy was to turn the situation into an opportunity for Jack to learn to cope with adversity and for me to inform and prepare myself to protect him in the long run. </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;"><br />
My family therapist guided me in the direction of some excellent work about children in educational settings: Alfred Adler, Rudolf Dreikurs, Jane Nelsen. (I will write about this later.) At her suggestion I brought Ann a copy of Nelsen’s “Positive Discipline,” which offers an excellent guideline for classroom management. “I don’t read these kinds of things,” she said. At home we tried Nelsen’s “positive approach” and started having family meetings based on her model to find solutions to classroom problems. These meetings eventually became regular means for us to address all kinds of issues that have come up over the years.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;"><br />
As for coping with the school situation I had to think of ways that suited who I am and what our family is like. We are not generally the kind of people who respond in kind to hostile and ignorant behavior—that kind of response is not in keeping with our “values,” the ones that Ann was so concerned about! After hearing what others had to say about Ann we had enough material to “fight” her. She was fond of “putting things on record”; we certainly had things to “put on record” on her. But what was the point of adding to the poisoned environment and creating adversarial relationships at our school? I have enough experience to know that in a public school battles can become grotesquely bureaucratic and in the end accomplish very little. You can easily waste an awful lot of time and energy fighting those battles and in the end everybody suffers and nothing really changes. I felt I had to find solutions that are best for Jack in the long run and reflect what I believe in as a parent.  </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;"><br />
That’s when I started talking to other mothers. And, lo and behold, I learned that a lot of boys were facing similar situations. I learned that having a hard time sitting still is not unique to Jack. I learned that he is not the only boy who is always testing limits and what he can get away with. I learned that he is far from the only one to be punished by losing recess every other day. In fact, Jack’s pediatrician told me that she was thinking of starting a group for mothers of boys who were having a hard time in school. I took detailed notes of what was going on at school, and with a little bit of research I came across what is called “the boy crisis.” I realized that boys are being punished and labeled and diagnosed with disorders at an alarming rate. </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;"><br />
The more I looked into the “crisis” the more I thought that a lot of the psychobabble and politically-correct nonsense that is thrown around against boys just translates into calling them “bad” without actually using that word. I started joking with other mothers about our “bad boys” and came up with the idea that we should start a support group: Mothers of Bad Boys. </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;"><br />
One day while <a href="../../../../BlogRetrieve.aspx_BlogID=4991&amp;PostID=98680.html">a friend </a>and I were chatting in my kitchen when Ann called. That was the call about Jack spitting at another child and her comment about “civil rights issues.” As chance would have it, my friend who was visiting that day was a public school teacher in New York City for many years and is African-American. She is from a very politically engaged family and has first-hand memories of the civil rights movement. As I reported Ann’s comment to her and explained the situation, her eyes got wider and wider. Her first comment was: "What does she know about the civil rights movement?" And her second one: “You’ve got to advocate for your son.”  </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;"><br />
The more I learned about what was happening to boys, however, the more I felt that advocating for my son alone is not enough. My experience is that individuals usually don’t get away with an attitude unless there is a greater trend supporting it. I suspected that the problem was larger than Jack’s teacher and realized that to advocate most effectively I would have to look at the bigger picture. I thought the best place to start is to raise consciousness about the difficulties boys are facing. So instead of fighting Ann I decided to channel my efforts in a more positive and effective direction. Instead of creating an angry and adversarial environment at our school I decided to create a forum to promote understanding, compassion, and positive action for boys.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;"><br />
One lazy afternoon over a nice glass of tea at an Indian restaurant I was venting my frustrations at Jack’s school situation to a friend of mine. I mentioned my joke about starting a Mothers of Bad Boys support group. The eyes of my friend, the publisher of a successful interactive website, suddenly flashed. “You must start a website,” he said. </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;"><br />
And so this website came into being!</span></p>
