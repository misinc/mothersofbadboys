<div class="post-body">
<p class="more-link"><p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><b><span style="line-height: 150%; color: #1f497d; font-size: 16px;">A background</span></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">So what kind of a kid is Jack?</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">Let’s go back to first grade, the first year that he was in a real classroom setting. Jack did not take to the structure of the classroom. He talked, he sang, he did not sit still, he pushed boundaries with other kids, he did not stick to rules—in short, he engaged in a lot of typical boy behavior. What didn’t help was the fact that he was almost the youngest in the class and could easily have started first grade the following year. We decided to put him in first grade not just because he was ready academically but because he was physically big for his age and holding him back would have made him a head taller than the rest of the kids. So we took a deep breath and sent him to first grade. To sum it up I’d say his social skills were not as developed as his intellectual skills and his physique, which, again, is a typical developmental pattern with boys. </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">At home too Jack liked to push limits. He was always testing to see how far he could go and what he could get away with. As a baby he liked to push against me to reach for things. Later, his toddler contrariness did not entirely go away. By four it turned into resistance. He resisted bath time, resisted getting dressed, resisted going out and resisted staying home, even at times resisted doing what he himself wanted to do, just for good measure. He was also very independent-minded and liked to take matters into his own hands. If he felt wronged, for instance, he would take on an older, bigger kid himself instead of going to an adult for help. He was attracted to butting heads and testing his strength with other boys. He wrestled, threw karate chops, fought with light sabers, and fired imaginary guns. I saw a T-shirt on a little boy once that read “Too many bad guys. Too little time.” That’s just what Jack was up to.  </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">Another personality trait of Jack is that that he does not like to repeat things. Even when he was very young he lost interest in games and puzzles after he figured them out once. Making him repeat things is still like pulling teeth. When he learns to do something he considers it done and does not like to repeat or demonstrate that knowledge or ability. So in first grade, once he copied a word or learned an addition or subtraction, he was done with it. He resisted doing it again tooth and nail. Being in a classroom environment of “practice, practice, practice” was frustrating for him and consequently for the teacher. </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">The mother of one of the best-behaved girls in first grade told me that her daughter complained about the teacher screaming at kids. As the mother of one of the kids who drove the teacher to yell I had sympathy for both the nice, quiet children and the teacher. Teaching a classroom full of quirky, fidgety kids is certainly not easy. Goodness knows that my own patience was frequently tried with only one kid. I could only imagine how disruptive and annoying it must have been when my son, for instance, poked his neighbor or burst into song while the teacher was trying to get everyone to work. I was certainly sympathetic to the teacher and the parents of the exemplary kids in the classroom but I can’t say I ever encountered any bitter complaints from anyone.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">So in first grade I was aware that Jack was not adjusting to the rigors of the classroom quickly enough but I did not have serious concerns. The advice of the first grade teacher at the end of the year was for Jack to take music and drama lessons since he seemed to have an aptitude for those. The afterschool teacher suggested team sports to improve his attitude about rules and to develop more team spirit. Nevertheless, when second grade started I thought it was time for Jack to make faster progress on classroom adjustment. During my first talk with the second grade teacher I was fully supportive of demanding more progress from Jack. I thought it was time for him to “grow up.”</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">That was my mistake—on two accounts. First, at age six and seven a kid still has an awfully long way to go before “growing up.” Growing up does not happen on demand or from one moment, or one year, to the next—this is an important point about which I will write more in the future. I have also learned the truth of the assertion that the challenges that kids encounter—and create—grow with them. There is no such thing as a parenting-made-easy blueprint and it is just wishful silliness to expect that one happy day you can just put parenting on cruise-control and be done with it.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">Second, I probably gave the wrong impression to the teacher. I come from a family of educators and grew up with a great deal of respect for the teaching profession and teachers themselves. But I think it was a mistake to give my full support to the second grade teacher before I knew her. I think I inadvertently made Ann feel righteous in adopting a “nip it in the bud” approach to what she saw as Jack’s “bad” classroom behavior. I will never know what she really thought but perhaps to Jack I gave the message that I was “on the teacher’s side.” And when for whatever reason the teacher singled Jack out for blame or “discipline,” he felt wronged not just by the teacher but also by me. Undoubtedly this made him act out more. </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">At any rate, I think Ann took my support of her as a kind of weakness in me. Perhaps she thought it was time for someone to exercise some authority and deal with Jack with an iron grip—and she took it upon herself to do that. Or perhaps it was my mistake to have cut her too much slack on account of being young and inexperienced. Given that she was not exactly unintelligent and uneducated I thought with some guidance she might learn to see what she was doing wrong. But whatever her shortcomings and my mistakes, I knew that there would be no quick and easy way of protecting Jack and coping with the situation. </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">Over the years Jack has grown quite articulate and I will certainly share his observations here. I have also used the time I spend with children to seek out their thoughts on situations that develop at school and between them in or out of school. I think, when all is said and done, the kids themselves are the best guides for us. But before we get to that, next I will write about how I handled the second grade situation.</span></p>

I mean, mine some times was defiant to her teacher's &quot;instruction&quot; whereas at home I would not see any resistance around the same task. Around age 7, Third Grade I realized that his challenging the teacher was merely an opportunity to act resistant/cool/bad , which was not allowed enough at home. Home was just too peaceful and boring I guess. For that reason I gave him more room to challenge me, Dad and his siblings. This strategy worked until junior high hit, when it was cool to be bad again!<br /><br />BTW I love your website.</div>  </div>

I was also baffled about Jack behaving worse at school than home. And I also wondered if we were strict at home so he felt more need to act out when not at home. Who knows. Wish I could go back and experiment!</div>  </div>
