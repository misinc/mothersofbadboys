<div class="post-body">
<p class="more-link"><span style="font-size: 12px;">
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #366092; font-size: 14px;"></span></p>
</span><span style="line-height: 150%; color: #000000; font-size: 14px;">
<p><span style="color: #1f497d; font-size: 16px;"><strong>The second grade nightmare</strong></span></p>
</span><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 12px;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 14px;">
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">This website grew out of a very bad year we had in second grade. It was that year that I learned that typical boy behavior can gain the unspoken label of Bad Boy for many boys. </p>
</span>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
</span><span style="font-size: 12px;">
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; color: #000000; font-size: 14px;">Our second grade nightmare started early in the school year. It was still September when my son’s teacher told me that she was worried that he would not make it to third grade. </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">This relatively young teacher was new to our school but in the couple of years that she had been there she was well liked. I had heard many good things about her and looked forward to a year with her. I did my usual duty of offering to volunteer in the classroom and was happy to follow her lead on that. In short, I started the year well-disposed toward this teacher and quite upbeat, so when she commented that Jack might not make it to third grade I was a little confused. Make it to third grade…?! This is a public school; practically everybody goes up to the next grade. What does this mean? I wondered—but I attributed the comment to her lack of experience and did my best to keep my attitude positive.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">But this September comment was just the beginning and things only got worse as the year went on. By Halloween I was getting alarmed. There was a pumpkin carving day at the class and I volunteered to help. The teacher, let’s call her Ann, had divided the children into groups of five or six with a parent volunteer at each table. My son and another girl, however, were put at one table by themselves, with me as the adult supervisor. Now, this girl, we all knew, was from a very difficult background and was consequently not an easy child. When my son was assigned at the same table alone with her I suspected that the two of them were now the official “untouchables” of the class. And being put in charge of them seemed to give me the message, “Nobody wants these children. You deal with them.”</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">Then the calls home started. Practically every day there would be a call from Ann, often a message on the answering machine. It looked like there was nothing that my son was doing that was not objectionable. There were frequently vague comments like “Jack made the wrong choices today” or “Jack was disrespectful to his classmates today.” One that I found particularly ridiculous was: “Jack took his classmates’ learning away today.” There were minor infractions such as “Jack made faces at his friends” and more serious-sounding ones such as “Jack stole money today.” </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">The messages started to feel like a kind of harassment.  I felt that Ann was harassing me so that I would harass Jack, so after a while I stopped asking him what had happened. At any rate, the accusations were silly and the worst of them, about stealing money, turned out not to be entirely accurate. As Jack and the boy whose money was “stolen” explained to me, Jack had found a dollar bill on the floor and instead of turning it to the teacher he had pocketed it. </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">At a meeting that Ann requested to have with me she told me that Jack had used inappropriate language. “I’m concerned about the values he’s learning at home,” she said. “Do you use sexually explicit language with him at home?” I wonder if she really thought that according to our family values it was OK for our kid to use profanity and steal. (Later I heard through the grapevine that a more experienced teacher had given Ann the advice that it was not her place to make comments about people’s “values.”) </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">By Christmas I was told that my son was “disrespectful to girls” and had called two girls names. I made him write apology cards to the children and buy them little presents from his allowance. But when I asked the mothers of the girls about the incident they knew nothing about it and said that their daughters liked Jack and kept his presents as favorite keepsakes. </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">Sexism was not the only charge against Jack. He was also accused of being racist when he spat at another child. “I’m very sensitive about civil rights issues,” Ann said, reporting the incident to me. When I checked with the yard staff they told me that there was a lot of random spitting going on during recess and nobody was singled out for spitting or being spat at. The most outrageously ignorant comment, however, was when Ann suggested that I have Jack tested for Asperger’s Syndrome. Now, anybody with the most elementary familiarity with “autism spectrum” disorders would be very hesitant to throw such diagnoses around. I mean, I have seen people calling kids “hyper” or even “ADD” but “autistic”?! I figured that to Ann that was just another label accusing Jack and our family of something – anything:  sexist, racist, autistic, bad family values. These all seemed pretty much of the same order to her.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">Meanwhile I was volunteering in the classroom as a reader. Ann’s rule was for the reader to bring in her own reading material and read to the children in a circle. As it turns out, if there’s one thing I’m good at it is reading. I know about books and read with a bit of drama to make it interesting to children. I brought in interesting stories from different countries and discussed them with the children. Kids love to express their thoughts and opinions so I gave them plenty of opportunity to do that. In fact that’s why I like to read to kids. I love to hear what they have to say. They can be pretty insightful and are often funny.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">The highlight of my reading sessions was when I brought in T. S. Eliot’s <em>Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats</em>. The kids did some grumbling at first – they were not accustomed to being challenged – but with a little gentle persistence on my part they soon got into it. I explained the character of each cat and the general plot and made sure they understood each line. Repeating the refrains was especially fun:<em>“</em>Macavity’s not there!<em>”</em> etc. </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">I noticed that during my reading Ann sat far away from the circle and shot me poisonous glances. I ignored them. The kids were enjoying the readings and I believed that what I was doing was good education for them. The teacher’s aide often commented on how much she enjoyed my reading too. The last book I brought in was <em>People</em> by Peter Spier. This is a sensitively written and wonderfully illustrated classic about all kinds of people: not just people from different cultures, but rich and poor people, people with different interests, professions, attitudes, etc. I never got to finish this book. Ann started making excuses to put off my reading sessions and finally cancelled them altogether. She said the librarian was going to read to the class from then on. After that, the time I spent in the classroom was practically eliminated. <br />
<br />
</span><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">Ann made a lot of mistakes – I won’t really get into that. But one of her most basic ones was that she seemed oblivious to the fact that people talk to each other. She should have known that I would of course try to verify her accusations against Jack with others, the way I did with the mothers of the two girls and the yard staff. She should have guessed that perhaps sometimes people would report things to me on their own. She just seemed strangely unaware that others were observing her. Here are some of the things that other teachers and staff told me about her: </span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">At one point Ann had told me that one of the other teachers had said that Jack was aggressive and had behavior problems. When I talked to that teacher she did not know what I was talking about. In fact she was shocked and said she would look into it. A few days later she called me to say that she was concerned that Ann had difficulty handling kids and that Jack was not the only child she was having problems with. This was confirmed by another teacher. </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">Another time, one of Jack’s extracurricular teachers told me that after an inappropriate touching incident during her period Ann had called her to find out if Jack had been the guilty one. This teacher was disturbed by Ann’s call and felt alarmed enough to report it to me. She said the incident had not even occurred during the period of Jack’s class.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">All through the year Ann insisted on, as she put it, putting things “on record.” She said of our interim principal that year – someone she vigorously fought not to have permanently hired – that the good thing about him was that he liked to put things on record. “But don’t worry,” she said to me, “in elementary school all these records get thrown away.” Rather bizarre, I thought!</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14px;">There were other incidents that are too elaborate to include here; maybe I’ll blog about them in the future.  But to make a long story short, Ann had certainly taken a dislike to Jack and our family and she harangued and harassed us the entire year. In the next couple of blogs I will concentrate on how I dealt with this situation and what I learned from the experience. </span></p>
